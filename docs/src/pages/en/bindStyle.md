This function is used to bind an object that describe the style of an element to
the actual element style. It takes a dom element or a selector as the first
argument and a function returning the object as the second argument.

The following code will bind color property and the backgroundColor property
value to the `variable.color` and `variable.bg` field.

```typescript
const variable = createVariable({ color: "black", bg: "#BADA55" });

bindStyle("#div-to-bind", (element) => ({
  color: variable.color,
  backgroundColor: variable.bg,
}));

variable.bg = "#C0FFEE"; //the div will now have #C0FFEE as backgroundColor
variable.color = "white"; //the div will now have white as the color
```
