This method is used to create an effect that will keep track of it's
dependencies and re-run every time they changed

```typescript
const variable = createVariable({ whosCool: "you" });
const ref = createRef(1);

createEffect(() => {
  console.log(variable.whosCool, ref.value);
});
//will log (you, 1) the first time

ref.value++;
//the effect run again logging (you, 2)

variable.whosCool = "whoever uses Sprinkle JS";
//the effect run again logging (whoever uses Sprinkle JS, 2)
```

You can also return a function that will be run before the new function to clean
up the previous effect.

```typescript
const variable = createVariable({ whosCool: "you" });
const ref = createRef(1);

createEffect(() => {
  console.log(variable.whosCool, ref.value);

  return () => {
    console.log("cleaning up");
  };
});
//will log (you, 1) the first time

ref.value++;
//the effect run again logging first "cleaning up" and then (you, 2)

variable.whosCool = "whoever uses Sprinkle JS";
//the effect run again logging first "cleaning up" and then (whoever uses Sprinkle JS, 2)
```
