This method is used to create a reactive variable for an object and map every
field to a css variable. It'll throw if you try to pass a primitive value to it.
In typescript you can pass only string or numbers as values of the object but
every value will be stringified before assigning it to the css variable so if
you pass a complex object you'll get "[object Object]" instead.

```typescript
//this will create two css variable at the root level --x and --y with the values of 0 and 0
//you can use those variable inside your css
const variable = createCssVariable({ x: 0, y: 0 });

//setting this will also set the --x css variable to 200
variable.x = 200;
```

if you use this variable inside a createEffect or inside another method whenever
you'll update the value the method will re-run.

You can also pass an object containing an equality function for every field of
the object that will determine how to check for equality for that field. By
default it will use `Object.is`.

```typescript
const variable = createCssVariable({ whosCool: "you" }, {
  whosCool: (before, after) => before.length === after.length,
});
```

The above variable will not trigger an effect re-run if the previous value has
the same length as the new value.

A third argument of this method is a selector or an HTMLElement of the element
you want to apply the css variables to. It default to `:root`. If the provided
selector does not select anything it will apply the css variable to the `:root`
